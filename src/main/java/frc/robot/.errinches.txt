notes

cant directly add to arc length, will overshoot b and err increases
cant shorten wheel diameter, overshoots a and b, same err


measurments(err)
a = distanceA, b = lengthB, err = err from wanted point
a(in), b(in) = err(in)

with shooter and shitz
80, 40 = 
80, 30 = 21
80, 20 = 13
80, 10 = 10
